9:Tab8,7.3 Protection, Registration, and Vesting of Deliverables: The Service Provider shall, immediately upon request by Teklabspace (during the engagement or after its termination), and at Teklabspace’s expense:  
(a) Apply, or join Teklabspace in applying, for any Intellectual Property Rights or other protection or registration (“Protection”) in the U.S. and any other part of the world, for or in relation to any Deliverables;  
(b) Execute all instruments and take all necessary actions to vest all obtained Intellectual Property Rights or Protections — and all rights, titles, and interests therein — absolutely and solely in Teklabspace or any nominee designated by Teklabspace; and  
(c) Sign and execute any documents, and perform any acts reasonably required by Teklabspace in connection with any proceedings regarding such applications, or in connection with publication or revocation of any Intellectual Property Rights or Protections.

7.4 Power of Attorney: The Service Provider hereby irrevocably appoints Teklabspace as its attorney, authorizing Teklabspace to act in the Service Provider’s name and on its behalf to perform any such acts, sign all necessary deeds and documents, and generally use the Service Provider’s name for the purpose of fully effecting this section. The Service Provider agrees that, with respect to third parties, a certificate signed by any duly authorized officer of Teklabspace confirming that any act, deed, or document falls within this authority shall be conclusive evidence of such authority.

7.5 Pre-Existing Intellectual Property:  
(a) Pre-Approval: The Service Provider shall not use any pre-existing Intellectual Property in connection with this Agreement unless:  
   (i) Such pre-existing Intellectual Property is specifically identified in the applicable Statement of Work (SOW); and  
   (ii) The Service Provider has the right to use such pre-existing Intellectual Property for the benefit of Teklabspace (and Teklabspace’s licensees), and to grant the licenses outlined in this section.

(b) License: If the Service Provider incorporates any pre-existing Intellectual Property into a Deliverable, or furnishes any pre-existing Intellectual Property in conjunction with a Deliverable, the Service Provider hereby grants Teklabspace a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual license to:  
   (i) Make, have made, sell, use, execute, reproduce, modify, adapt, display, perform, distribute, create derivative works of, import, and disclose the pre-existing Intellectual Property or products and services using such Intellectual Property in conjunction with the Deliverable; and  
   (ii) Authorize or sublicense others to do any or all of the foregoing.0:{"P":null,"b":"a6Mn3sq8MAxtOcWnFVE8F","p":"/Nextjsfrontend","c":["","SLA","InventionsAndDeliverables"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["SLA",{"children":[["slug","InventionsAndDeliverables","d"],{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/Nextjsfrontend/_next/static/css/602e93a69c2da5c8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/Nextjsfrontend/_next/static/css/73776e0af30eb1b4.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_29c992","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"position":"bottom-right","reverseOrder":false}],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$5","errorStyles":[],"errorScripts":[],"template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","$L7",null,{}],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]]}]}]]}],{"children":["SLA",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["slug","InventionsAndDeliverables","d"],["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"py-12  mx-10 min-h-screen","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-[#292F43] text-center mb-10","children":["SERVICE ",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-[#B70AC1]","children":"LEVEL"}]," AGREEMENT"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-center text-sm sm:text-base text-[#B70AC1] mb-6","children":["To ensure that we serve you better, we created our code of conduct.",["$","br",null,{}],"Kindly read through and agree before sign up to our services."]}],["$","$L8",null,{"card":{"title":"Inventions and Other Deliverables","description":"7.1 Creation of Deliverables: Service Provider may make or create Deliverables during the term of any SOW or this Agreement.7.2 Disclosure and Ownership of Deliverables: Service Provider must immediately disclose to Teklabspace all Deliverables and all Intellectual Property Rights.
